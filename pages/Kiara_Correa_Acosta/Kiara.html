                    <p class="text">
                        My name is Kiara Correa Acosta. I graduated from All City Leadership Secondary School and I am attending Smith College in the Fall of 2018. I am 17 years old.
                        <br> I started coding in my Junior year of Highschool with ScriptEd, from this foundations course I went on to do the ScriptEd Summer Academy. During this time I had the chance to work with a mock client. This led to me take more
                        interest in the world of web designing.
                        <br> I proceeded to be a part of the advanced course that ScriptEd offered at a tech company. I was placed at Oscar Health for the year.

                    <p class="text">
                        While my time at Rent the Runway I experience a lot. From the start I was allowed to set meetings and attend events. Some meeting I made were with marketing and social media director, college reps, and current software engineers. This opportunity gave me
                        the knowledge on how to manage my time while being productive with my time.
                        <br> Some non-tech experiences that I have had the pleasure to be apart of is the Company Scavenger Hunt and the Company’s Beach Day. My team actually won the Scavenger Hunt and I met a group of people that I hadn’t really had
                        interactions with till this event.
                        <br> Lastly my internship goal by the end was to make the most of this opportunity. I think that this was completed the moment in which I had a conversation with Jennifer Hyman, the co-founder and CEO of Rent the Runway.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
                    <p class="text">
                        My time at Rent the Runway, I have worked on learning React and Ruby. Learning two new languages, Ruby and React was a bit time consuming but I still managed to work on the projects given.
                        <br> I paired with current engineers to work on tickets to help dismiss certain bugs that have been reported by the CX admins. In addition to these tickets for bugs I have helped in styling certain pages for the clarity of CX admin
                        users. Lastly I worked on making a Contact Us page for current users.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p class="text">
                        “If your not going to speak up, how will the world supposed to know you exist”
                        <br> <br>
                        I took this quote to heart when being at Rent the Runway. As a 17 year old software engineer intern, I knew that I would not really be noticed unless I put myself out there. Personally I am usually shy around people I barely
                        know but I made sure that I was going to step out of my bubble. I did this by setting up meetings on my own, going to company events and talks, asking questions, and filling out forms / applications.
                        <br> I even presented at Drinks and Demos when it was not required. 
                        <br>
                        Not only did I have to speak to put myself out there but I also know that if you do not ask for help on something you are stuck on, nothing will get done at the
                        end.
                        <br> Another key takeaway I encountered was that everyone at the company was really opened to helping me in anyway possible. Whether that be in pairing to teach me something new or even to talk about their experiences.
                        <br>
